## ✨ Highlights

*User-Centric Remote Sensing Analysis (URSA)* aims to explore a new paradigm of remote sensing analysis based on Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi-agent collaboration. It enables human users to directly communicate their remote sensing needs, while autonomous AI agents collaborate to perform task planning, data analysis, and result generation.

URSA paves the way towards more accessible, interactive, and intelligent remote sensing analysis in the future.
