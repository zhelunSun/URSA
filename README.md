## ‚ú® Highlights

*User-Centric Remote Sensing Analysis (URSA)* aims to explore a new paradigm of remote sensing analysis based on Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi-agent collaboration. It enables human users to directly communicate their remote sensing needs, while autonomous AI agents collaborate to perform task planning, data analysis, and result generation.

URSA paves the way towards more accessible, interactive, and intelligent remote sensing analysis in the future.

## üöÄ Prototype: ExpertsRS

As an initial demonstration of the URSA framework, we developed **ExpertsRS** ‚Äî a prototype system that showcases how user-centric remote sensing analysis can be enabled through a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered multi-agent collaboration system.

ExpertsRS is built based on [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen), and implements a flexible workflow where multiple AI agents interact to support users in remote sensing analysis tasks.
