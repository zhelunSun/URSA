## ‚ú® Highlights

Remote sensing analysis transforms remotely sensed data into actionable information across various domains. Nonetheless, conventional data-centric methodologies establish barriers between remote sensing data and downstream users possessing limited expertise in the field. *User-Centric Remote Sensing Analysis (URSA)* framework aims to explore a new paradigm of remote sensing analysis leveraging state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs). It enables human users to directly express their needs in natural language without technical barriers, while LLM-powered AI agents can understand the needs and perform according RS analysis pipeline fully automatically and return interpretable results.

URSA paves the way towards more accessible, interactive, and intelligent remote sensing analysis in the future.

## üöÄ Prototype: ExpertsRS

As an initial demonstration of the URSA framework, we developed **ExpertsRS** ‚Äî a prototype system that showcases how user-centric remote sensing analysis can be enabled through a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered multi-agent system.

ExpertsRS is built based on [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen), and implements a flexible workflow where multiple AI agents interact to support users in remote sensing analysis tasks.

**Highlights of ExpertsRS:**
- The system effectively guides users to interact using **natural language**, enabling them to express their needs **without technical barriers**.
- The system possesses the capability to **autonomously select and process** pertinent remote sensing data, thereby ensuring **efficient and context-specific analysis**.
- The system's outputs were consistent with those produced by a human expert. Furthermore, by leveraging LLMs' knowledge retrieval and inference capabilities, the system could interpret results and provide additional contextual information, rendering the **outputs easy to interpret and valuable for decision-making**.
